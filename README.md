## General flow

DM picks cypher settings for languages
DM assigns languages known to players
User inputs a message, selects a language
Message is run through cypher based on language choice
Cyphertext delivered to recipient or chat
If PC knows language
    PM translation
Else
    # PM language used if DM allows?

## Ideas

Custom fonts?
Discord or simple copy/paste??
Vocalize or text based on context
